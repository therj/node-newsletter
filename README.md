# node-newsletter
Simple signup form integrated with MailChimp API

Tutorial starts from [here](https://wp.me/p4brKM-G).

```
git clone https://github.com/therj/node-newsletter.git
cd node-newsletter
npm install
```
Get the API key from MailChimp.

Apparently, the requests do not use the plain API key.
Please use the tutorial from [here](https://wp.me/p4brKM-1w "here")
to get your own generated code using postman.

>You can use my API key until it's available (no time period guarantee).
This should save you from whole postman tutorial, if that's not what you're looking for.
Make sure you don't submit your real email. Anybody may spam you!

Finally run the app with:
```
node index.js
```
